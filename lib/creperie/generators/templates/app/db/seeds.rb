# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database
# with its default values. The data can then be loaded with `rake db:seed`
# or created alongside the database with `rake db:setup`.
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
